# AME Wizard Core

Core functionality used by AME Wizard.

## CLI Usage

*We do not recommend CLI usage for normal users, instead use [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/).*

1. Download `CLI-Standalone.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Ameliorated-LLC/trusted-uninstaller-cli/releases/latest)

2. Extract the downloaded archive

3. Inside the extracted folder, place a Playbook of choice

4. Extract the Playbook with 7zip using the password `malte`

5. Open **Command Prompt** as administrator and navigate to the extracted CLI-Standalone folder

6. Run `TrustedUninstaller.CLI.exe "<Extracted Playbook Folder>"`

   Optionally, you can specify options like in the following example:
   ```
   TrustedUninstaller.CLI.exe "AME 11 v0.7" browser-firefox enhanced-security
   ```

## Offline Functionality

The AME Wizard can now run without an internet connection, with limited functionality. To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. Pre-download the required dependencies using the provided script in the `TrustedUninstaller.Shared/AmeliorationUtil.cs` file.
